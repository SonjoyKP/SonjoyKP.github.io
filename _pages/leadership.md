### President, Executive Committee (2016-17), Students Co-operative Organization (SCO)
#### Kaliganj, Jhenaidah, Bangladesh
***
- This volunteer organization works in our local area and is run by university students. We help local high school students by showing them the proper direction for admission to public universities. In addition, the organization gives small amounts of scholarships to unprivileged students. The organization also does social work like tree-plantation campaigns, anti-drug campaigns, and free blood group sampling for local people. 

- Every year we arrange a reunion among local students so that they can share their experiences. In addition, each year, the permanent advisors declare a working committee consisting of 20-25 members to run those activities for the upcoming year. I was selected as President of the 2016-17 working committee. I organized a few meetings during that year to make the reunion program successful. I also raised funds from our alumni to keep running the organization's regular activities.
