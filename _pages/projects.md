## Academic/Professional Projects:

### Configuring Hadoop Cluster and Executing Big Data Applications with Apache Spark
***
- This project aims to configure a Hadoop cluster with Apache Hadoop as the underlying file system and Apache Spark as the execution engine. The main objective is to develop and run various small-scale applications utilizing the power of Hadoop and Spark. The project involves setting up the necessary infrastructure, configuring the cluster, and implementing several applications to leverage the capabilities of these technologies for handling big data efficiently.

### User Folder Migration
***
- Created a user folder migration functionality enabling 200 clients to seamlessly transition their thousands of user reports, graphs, imports, and other user components to a new folder structure. This transition occurred without any disruptions to ongoing scheduled tasks, batch processes, and favorite items. 

- Employing a Blue-green deployment strategy, we initially launched the feature within our internal system, meticulously assessing its impact due to its magnitude. Subsequently, we executed a gradual release for clients, ensuring a controlled and effective integration.

### Enhancing Vending Machine Application with Microservices and Containerization
***
- This project uses microservices architecture and containerization to improve a vending machine application. By replacing the weather selection mechanism, creating a new microservice for beverage preferences, and updating relevant functions, the project aims to optimize the vending machine application. The utilization of containerization, specifically Docker, facilitates seamless deployment and management of the application, enabling easier scaling and maintenance.

### AI-Powered Reversi Game
***
- This project focuses on developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Reversi game, featuring a visually appealing and interactive game interface created using Java Swing. The game employs the powerful alpha-beta pruning algorithm, enabling the computer player to intelligently determine its next move, resulting in a challenging and strategic gameplay experience for users.

### 4-bit Computer System Design
***
- We designed a 4-bit Computer System based on Simple As Possible (SAP) architecture. The computer system could run 28 assembly instructions. I was involved in designing the assembly instructions and implementing the system in Proteus Design Suite for simulating the system.

### Hall Management System
***
- The project involved the development of a comprehensive system for the university hall office, which included a desktop application with a Java Swing interface for efficient information management. In addition, a web application was created using the Laravel framework ensuring seamless accessibility and advanced features. Both applications were integrated with a MySQL database to ensure reliable data storage and retrieval, facilitating streamlined administrative processes and enhancing overall efficiency.

### 29 Card Game
***
- The project involved implementing a 29-card game using Java Multi-threading, enabling concurrent execution of multiple tasks and efficient gameplay. The gameâ€™s server-client communication was implemented using Java Socket Programming, ensuring reliable and real-time interaction between players. This approach facilitated seamless communication and synchronization between the game server and connected clients, enhancing the overall multiplayer gaming experience.
